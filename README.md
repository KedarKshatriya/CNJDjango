## The problem Crypto Num-Juggle solves
* It provides an average user easy onboarding with the blockchain-based game using portis wallet. 
* Interaction with blockchain is much faster because of Matic's Plasma framework.
* The auto rewarding system checks the user's best score is stored on the Matic blockchain using their wallet addresses. 
* The game depends on the Player's  Best score, the more the player scores the more Matic tokens he would be rewarded.


## Challenges we ran into
* The integration with the portis wallet was a tricky task.
* Saving the game state and best scores in realtime, while keeping in mind to not reduce the game performance was really tough.

<br>But we were able to successfully overcome all these challenges.
